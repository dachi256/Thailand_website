                    <h3 class="text-center">1. What are the dynamics of tradition and creativity in contemporary cultural expressions?</h3>
                    <p>In contemporary cultural expressions there is a dynamic interplay between tradition and creativity. This blend is evident in places like the works of artists such as Inson Wongsam. Traditional motifs and historical narratives are often reinterpreted and infused with modern techniques and perspectives. For instance, the contemporary artworks seen at Maiiam Contemporary Arts Museum often juxtapose traditional themes with innovative artistic methods, reflecting a dialogue between the past and present. Picasso's cubist painting 'Guernica' that explores the chaos of the bombing of Guernica during WW2 is reinterpreted by Aung Htun in 'Burmica' to represent the tragedies and the heroes of the Myanmar conflict.</p>

                <div class="question" style="margin-top: 40px;">
                    <h3 class="text-center">2. What capacity does contemporary cultural expression have to address what issues?</h3>
                    <p>Contemporary cultural expression in the Mekong region has a significant capacity to address a wide range of issues, including social, political, and environmental concerns. Art can highlight human rights issues, as seen in the Maiiam Contemporary Arts Museum exhibition on displaced persons along the Thailand-Myanmar border. This exhibition uses art to document and bring attention to the struggles and resilience of displaced communities. The exhibitions and safe spaces that can openly discuss sensitive topics such as faults in the government's responses and the crisis on the border that would otherwise face suppression from the government.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, Dhepsiri Creative Space and Friends without Borders use art to foster social cohesion, promote environmental awareness, and give voice to marginalized communities. Not only does the Creative Space draw together various artists otherwise active in independent mediums, but it also serves as a community center for local meetings, teaching spaces and at times exhibition spaces for niche artistic expressions such as shadow puppetry that otherwise would not be able to afford an independent showcase. These various forms of art that combine old crafts with new perspectives truly bring to the surface the current issues face in the region, from social to political and environmental concerns.</p>

                <div class="question" style="margin-top: 40px;">
                    <h3 class="text-center">3. Who is opposed to contemporary art and why?</h3>
                    <p>Opposition to contemporary art often comes from conservative and traditionalist segments of society, including certain political and religious groups. These opponents may view contemporary art as a threat to traditional values and cultural norms. They may also perceive it as politically subversive or socially disruptive. For example, contemporary art that addresses political issues, such as government corruption or human rights abuses, can attract opposition from authorities who see it as a challenge to their power. The non-communicative nature and euphemism allusions of contemporary art in particular can effectively serve as resilient cultural touch-points that circumvent censorship attempts, and thus attract wariness from would-be suppressors.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, art that challenges social norms around gender, sexuality, or religion may be resisted by those who hold conservative views on these topics. Although Thailand is relatively progressive in the treatment and debate over gender minorities and the queer community, overt depictions of sexuality are still shunned as obscene. Places like the Book Republic offer safe spaces that allow people to have open discussion about such issues and more. The organization face lashback from the Thai National Security as they argued that Book Republic would destroy relationships between the countries. The seminar they organized which targeted sensitive issues on democracy, monarchy and constitution was considered problematic and resulted in their loss of funding, being forced to stop operating for a year.</p>

                <div class="question" style="margin-top: 40px;">
                    <h3 class="text-center">4. How do contemporary artistic expressions relate to identity?</h3>
                    <p>Contemporary artistic expressions play a crucial role in shaping and reflecting individual and collective identities. In the Mekong region, artists often explore themes of cultural heritage, national identity, and personal experiences in their work. At venues like Book Re
                    and Sriwan Janehuttakarnkit's studio at Sridonmoon Art Space, artists engage with questions of identity through their art, reflecting on their own cultural backgrounds, histories, and experiences. This process helps to affirm and sometimes challenge existing notions of identity, offering new perspectives and fostering a deeper understanding of the diverse identities within the region.

                    <h3 class="text-center">5. Who is responsible for censorship and self-censorship?</h3>
                    <p>Censorship in the Mekong region is caused by different partie, including government authorities, religious institutions, and the artists themselves. Government censorship often arises from laws and regulations that limit freedom of expression, especially regarding political content or criticism of the country. As a result, artworks addressing governmental structures are closely examined and often suppressed.</p>
                    <p>Self-censorship occurs when artists modify or restrain their work to avoid potential repercussions, such as legal penalties, and financial loss, they may also be afraid of losing their funding if their artwork includes content that is considered as inappropriate. This not only stifles the creation of cultural works but also hinders the curatorial efforts needed for art pieces to be exhibited or distributed to the public.</p>

                        <p>I was surprised to learn that the Thai government and people are really conscious about the importance of nature. The laws against illegal wood cutting and reusing old house wood to build a museum in the national park of Chiang Rai are some of great examples.</p>
